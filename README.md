# Voting Stats
A Python program that processes voting data for candidates, calculates total and average votes, determines each candidate's vote percentage, and allows users to search for a specific candidate to view their statistics.

## About the Project
This project demonstrates working with Python **lists, loops, and conditional statements** to handle multiple inputs and display structured output. The program includes input validation for the number of candidates and handles searches for candidates by name.

The code for this project is included in the attached Python file (VotingStats.py) and can be run directly to see these concepts in action

## Skills Practiced
- Python **input handling** and **validation**  
- **Lists** to store candidate names, votes, and percentages  
- **Loops** (for loops) to process multiple candidates  
- **Mathematical operations** to calculate totals, averages, and percentages  
- **Conditional statements** (if, else) to handle candidate search results  
- Implementing **search functionality** to find a candidate by name and display their stats
